All shared parking arrangements require a conditional \nuse permit in conformance with Chapter 15-22.  \n \n3. \nCriteria. In order to approve a conditional use permit for shared \nparking, the Planning & Zoning Commission shall find, based upon \nreasonable documentation provided by the applicant, that the \narrangement (1) presents no substantial conflict or overlap of the \nprincipal operating hours of the uses for which the sharing of parking is \nproposed and (2) an adequate maintenance agreement exists between the \nowner(s) of the lot and the owner(s) of the principal land uses, if \ndifferent, utilizing the shared parking lot. \n \n4. \nOff-Street Parking Adjustment.

In order to \napprove an administrative adjustment for cooperative parking, he or she \nshall find, based upon documentation provided by the applicant(s), that \nthe arrangement (1) meets the location criteria outlined in Chapter 15-\n15-3(D)(3), and (2) an adequate maintenance agreement exists between \nthe owners of the lot or lots utilizing the cooperative parking lot. \n \n3 \nLocation of Cooperative Parking Facility.

The Zoning Administrator is authorized to \napprove an administrative adjustment as follows: \n \na.

    "text": "The following principals shall control the computation of sign area and sign \nheight: \n1. \nComputation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face (which \nis also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) \nshall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, \ntriangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits \nof the writing, representation, emblem or other display, together with \nany material or color forming an integral part of the background of the \ndisplay or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure \n\n \n92 \n \nagainst which it is placed, but not including any supporting framework, \nbracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise \nmeets the requirements of this Ordinance and is clearly incidental to the \ndisplay itself. \n \n2. \nComputation of area of multifaced signs. The sign area for a sign with \nmore than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all \nsign faces visible from any one point. When two (2) identical sign faces \nare placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be examined from \nany point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the \nsame sign structure and are not more than forty-two (42) inches apart, \nthe sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one (1) of the \nfaces. \n \n3. \nComputation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the \ndistance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the \nhighest attached component of the sign. Normal grade is defined as the \nlower of: \n \na. \nThe existing grade prior to construction; or \n \nb. \nThe newly established grade after construction. \n \nG. \nGeneral Regulations. The following regulations shall apply to all signs unless \notherwise indicated: \n \n1. \nExcept as required by law, no sign shall be displayed without the \nconsent of the legal owner of the lot on which the sign is located. For \npurposes of this section, the term “owner” shall mean the holder of the \nlegal title to the lot and any party and person holding a present legal \nright to possession, control, or use of the lot. \n \n2. \nExcept as required by law or otherwise permitted by the City, any sign \ninstalled or placed on public property shall be deemed illegal and shall \nbe forfeited to the public and subject to confiscation. In addition to \nother remedies hereunder, the City shall have the right to recover from \nthe owner or person placing such sign the cost of removal and disposal \nof such sign. \n \n3. \nNo wall sign shall project over the public right-of-way or sidewalk \nunless the building or structure to which the sign is attached is less than \nfive (5) feet from said right-of-way or sidewalk. In such situations, the \nsign shall be placed at an adequate height so as not to interfere with \npedestrians, vehicular traffic, or snow removal. \n \nH. \nPermanent Signs. The sign requirements set forth herein shall apply to all \npermanent signs as defined herein.  \n \n1. \nGeneral Standards.  All permanent signs shall conform to the following \nstandards: \n \na. \nAll signs shall be constructed of permanent materials and shall \nbe permanently attached to the ground, a building, or another \nstructure by direct attachment, frame, or sign structure. \n \n\n \n93 \n \nb. \nAll signs shall be constructed to withstand a wind load of \nthirty (30) pounds per square foot. \n \nc. \nSigns shall be maintained in a safe and legible condition at all \ntimes, including the replacement of defective or damaged \nparts, painting, repainting, cleaning, and other services \nrequired for maintenance of said signs. Signs that are not \nmaintained shall be either removed or brought into compliance \nimmediately upon written notice. Any expenses incurred by \nthe City during the removal or maintenance of a private sign \nshall be the responsibility of its owner. \n \n2. \nSigns Not Requiring a Permit.

Private wastewater systems shall be allowed within the City as \nfollows: \n \n1. If the lot is less than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet in surface \narea and the public sewer is either not within two hundred (200) feet of \nthe property line or is not reasonably accessible as determined by the \nCity Engineer, a holding tank may be installed that complies with \nChapter 15-15-15(E). \n \n2. Lots greater than or equal to twenty thousand (20,000) square feet in \nsurface area where the public sewer is either not within two hundred \n(200) feet of the property line or not reasonably accessible as \ndetermined by the City Engineer, may either install a holding tank in \ncompliance with Chapter 15-14-15(E) or a septic system in compliance \nwith Chapter 15-15-15(F). \n \nC.  \nApplicable Law.

In the event the holding tank or any of its connections are \ncovered prior to the inspection, it shall be the sole responsibility of the \ndeveloper or owner of the lot to perform such excavations as necessary \nto allow inspection of the private wastewater system.  \n \n3. Maintenance. All holding tanks shall be maintained as follows: \n \na. All holding tanks shall be maintained so as to prevent any seepage or \nleakage. No drain field or other means of underground distribution \nshall be installed on the lot. \n \nb.
